# SETUP


Once you have setup your module and you have written your code, you can build your app with the following tasks:


```
gulp js          //lint, bundle, and uglify your js
gulp less        //convert your less to css for your module
gulp less-page   //convert your less to css for your gh-pages page
gulp test        //test your module
gulp watch       //watch for changes to css, js and tests, and run the above gulp tasks accordingly
gulp watch-tests //watch for changes to tests and run phantomjs accordingly
gulp run         //run this module locally on port 8000
gulp             //run all of the above tasks in sequence listed above
```
